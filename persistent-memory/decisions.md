# Architectural Decisions

## 2025-10-25: Monorepo Task Management with Turborepo

- **Decision:** To use Turborepo for managing tasks in the monorepo.
- **Rationale:** Turborepo provides efficient caching and parallel execution of tasks, which is beneficial for a monorepo setup with multiple applications and packages.
- **Impact:** Requires defining tasks in `turbo.json` and corresponding scripts in `package.json` files. Initial setup involved correcting `turbo.json` syntax to align with Turborepo's expected configuration (moving commands to `package.json` scripts).

## 2025-10-25: ES Module Syntax Enforcement

- **Decision:** To strictly enforce ES module syntax across the codebase, especially in Next.js applications and shared UI packages.
- **Rationale:** Next.js 15 and modern JavaScript development heavily rely on ES modules. Inconsistent module systems (mixing CommonJS and ES modules) can lead to build errors and unexpected behavior.
- **Impact:** Required auditing `package.json` files to ensure `"type": "module"` is present where appropriate, and converting configuration files (e.g., `postcss.config.js`) from CommonJS to ES module syntax. This also necessitated updating various dependencies to versions fully compatible with ES modules.
