# Architectural Decisions

## 2025-10-27: Comprehensive CI/CD and Testing Strategy

- **Decision:** To implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and testing strategy to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and automate routine tasks.
- **Rationale:** To create a robust "safety net" that catches bugs, build failures, and security issues early in the development process, based on lessons learned from previous development attempts.
- **Components & Key Decisions:**
  - **Unit/Component Testing:** Standardize on `vitest` for fast, isolated tests within each application and package.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Utilize `playwright` for browser-based E2E tests that simulate real user flows. These tests will be located in a dedicated `apps/e2e` package.
  - **Automated Security Scanning:** Integrate GitHub's `CodeQL` action into the CI pipeline to automatically scan for common vulnerabilities.
  - **Branch Protection:** The `main` branch will be protected, requiring all CI checks (linting, building, testing, security scans) to pass before a Pull Request can be merged.
  - **Dependency Management:** Enable `Dependabot` to automate the process of keeping dependencies up-to-date.

## 2025-10-25: Monorepo Task Management with Turborepo

- **Decision:** To use Turborepo for managing tasks in the monorepo.
- **Rationale:** Turborepo provides efficient caching and parallel execution of tasks, which is beneficial for a monorepo setup with multiple applications and packages.
- **Impact:** Requires defining tasks in `turbo.json` and corresponding scripts in `package.json` files. Initial setup involved correcting `turbo.json` syntax to align with Turborepo's expected configuration (moving commands to `package.json` scripts).

## 2025-10-25: ES Module Syntax Enforcement

- **Decision:** To strictly enforce ES module syntax across the codebase, especially in Next.js applications and shared UI packages.
- **Rationale:** Next.js 15 and modern JavaScript development heavily rely on ES modules. Inconsistent module systems (mixing CommonJS and ES modules) can lead to build errors and unexpected behavior.
- **Impact:** Required auditing `package.json` files to ensure `"type": "module"` is present where appropriate, and converting configuration files (e.g., `postcss.config.js`) from CommonJS to ES module syntax. This also necessitated updating various dependencies to versions fully compatible with ES modules.
