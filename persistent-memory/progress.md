  - Added steps for linting, type checking, building, unit testing, E2E testing, and security scanning.
  - Installed `vitest` and added `test` scripts to `apps/web`, `apps/docs`, `apps/chrome-extension`, and `packages/ui` for unit/component testing.
  - Created a dedicated `apps/e2e` package for Playwright E2E tests.
  - Installed Playwright and created a `playwright.config.ts` file configured to run against the `web` application.
  - Added an example Playwright test case.
  - Integrated `CodeQL` into the CI pipeline for automated security analysis.
  - Fixed a `lint-staged` pre-commit hook failure by updating `turbo.json` to declare the `CI` environment variable for all relevant tasks.

- **2025-10-25**:

  - Updated `next` and `@next/eslint-plugin-next` packages to their latest versions.
