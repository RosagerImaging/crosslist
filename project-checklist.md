# Project: Landing Page Visual Enhancements

**Date Started**: 2025-12-25
**Status**: In Progress

## User Instructions

Make the following changes to the landing page file at /docs/ux-design/landing-page.html:

**Requirements:**

1. **Background Grid Enhancement:**
   - Keep the existing vertical background grid intact
   - Create a second grid that appears to be laying flat (horizontal/floor-like) at a 90-degree angle to the existing grid
   - This new horizontal grid should have perspective with lines converging at a vanishing point on the right side of the screen
   - Make it appear to fade out into the distance (perspective effect)
   - Make this new grid more opaque and noticeable than the current grid

2. **Interactive Animation:**
   - Add a mouse-following animation effect
   - Use the dark teal brand color for this effect (#0d9488 or similar dark teal from the design)

3. **Neo-Brutalist Card Styling:**
   - Add black outlines to all cards to enhance the neo-brutalist aesthetic
   - Maintain all other existing card styling and layout

4. **Constraints:**
   - Keep everything else the same (layout, content, other styling)
   - Preserve all existing functionality
