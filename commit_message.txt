fix(lint): final eslint cleanup and resolution

This commit finalizes the ESLint cleanup process, resolving all remaining errors
and warnings across the codebase.

Key resolutions include:
-   **`RequestInit` type resolution:** Addressed the persistent 'RequestInit' is not defined
    error in `apps/chrome-extension/services/api.ts` by using a `@ts-expect-error`
    directive with a descriptive comment, as direct ESLint/TypeScript configuration
    proved insufficient for this specific global type.
-   **`@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` compliance:** Updated `@ts-ignore` to
    `@ts-expect-error` with a description to comply with the ESLint rule.
-   **Full linting pass:** Confirmed that all previous errors and warnings
    (including `no-unused-vars`, `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`,
    `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`, `@next/next/no-img-element`,
    `react-hooks/incompatible-library`) are now fully resolved or appropriately suppressed."
