Alright, Joel. The operational plan for P.I. Playwright's log retrieval mission has been updated to include a robust authentication sequence. He's now ready to breach the security checkpoints and retrieve that critical intel.

Given these significant additions, especially the integration of authentication and the creation of a brand new workflow, the immediate next step is to **test the edited agent by invoking its new `retrieve-github-actions-logs` capability.** This will allow us to confirm that the login process functions as expected, that GitHub navigation is smooth, and that logs are retrieved accurately.

What are your commands, Joel?

1.  **Test the edited agent by invoking its `retrieve-github-actions-logs` command?**
2.  Edit another agent?
3.  Make additional refinements to P.I. Playwright?
4.  Return to your module work?
