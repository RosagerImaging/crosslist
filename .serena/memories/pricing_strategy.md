# Pricing Strategy

This document outlines the pricing strategy for Crosslist, as detailed by Joel.

## Three-Tiered Subscription Model

1.  **Basic Plan (Low Price):**
    *   **Target User:** Occasional resellers (e.g., cleaning out personal closets). Highly price-sensitive.
    *   **Features:** Access to a limited set of core features.
    *   **AI Tokens:** A small, introductory allotment of AI tokens per month.

2.  **Standard Plan (Medium/High Price):**
    *   **Target User:** "Side Hustle" resellers who expect a steady second income.
    *   **Features:** Access to all main functionality of the application.
    *   **Value Prop:** Priced competitively, likely below most competitors, offering great value.
    *   **AI Tokens:** A generous allotment of AI tokens per month.

3.  **Professional Plan (Max Price):**
    *   **Target User:** Power-sellers and professional online resellers running a legitimate business.
    *   **Features:** All features from the Standard Plan, plus advanced business analytics, tax tracking, and other niche, business-oriented functions.
    *   **AI Tokens:** A large allotment of AI tokens per month.

## AI Token System

*   **Core Concept:** Each subscription tier comes with a specific number of AI tokens per month. These tokens are consumed when using AI-powered features (e.g., photo background removal, automated description writing).
*   **Flexibility:** Users can use their token allotment as they see fit across the features available in their plan. This prevents them from feeling like they are paying for features they don't use.
*   **Top-Up Option:** Users can purchase additional AI tokens at any time during the month.
*   **Rollover:** Additionally purchased tokens will roll over to future months, providing extra value and flexibility.
*   **Business Model:** This model ensures the company does not bear the upfront cost of excessive AI usage from any single user. The cost of AI is directly tied to its consumption, funded by the user.
