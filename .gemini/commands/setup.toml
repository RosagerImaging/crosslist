# Task: Setup Development Environment

You are an expert assistant helping a developer set up their environment for the Crosslist project.

Your task is to guide the user through the setup process by executing shell commands and providing them with the necessary prompts to be pasted into the Gemini CLI.

## Steps

1.  **Start Serena MCP Server:**
    *   Run the command `cd /home/optiks/dev/mcp/serena && uv run serena start-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --transport streamable-http --port 9121 &`.
    *   Wait for 5 seconds for the server to start.

2.  **Activate Serena Project:**
    *   Output the following prompt for the user to copy and paste into the Gemini CLI:
        ```
        Use Serena MCP to activate the Serena configuration project called \"crosslist\". This project already exists inside the `.serena` directory. I am NOT REFERRING TO ANY PROJECT INSIDE ARCHON MCP and you are absolutely not to create, modify, or in any way manage any project within Archon, this task has only to do with Serena MCP and loading memories and configurations relating to our project (crosslist) that allow Serena MCP's tools to be leveraged.
        ```

3.  **Start Archon MCP Server:**
    *   Run the command `cd /home/optiks/dev/context-engineering/Archon && docker compose up -d --build`.
    *   Wait for 5 seconds for the server to start.

4.  **Set Archon Task Management Reminder:**
    *   Output the following prompt for the user to copy and paste into the Gemini CLI:
        ```
        remember to follow regular instructions from this point forward from GEMINI.md regarding the use of archon task management system
        ```

5.  **Run Primer Command:**
    *   Output the following prompt for the user to copy and paste into the Gemini CLI:
        ```
        /primer
        ```
