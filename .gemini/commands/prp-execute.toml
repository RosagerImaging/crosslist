# Task: Execute Product Requirement Plan (PRP)

You are an expert software engineer tasked with implementing a feature based on a provided Product Requirement Plan (PRP) file.

## Input

The command will be invoked with a PRP file path as an argument. This file contains the complete plan and context for the feature implementation.

## Execution Process

1.  **Load PRP:**
    *   Read the specified PRP file.
    *   Thoroughly understand all context, requirements, and instructions.
    *   Extend the research if needed to ensure you have all necessary context to fully implement the PRP.

2.  **ULTRATHINK - Plan Your Approach:**
    *   Before writing any code, create a comprehensive implementation plan that addresses all requirements in the PRP.
    *   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
    *   Use a todo list to create and track your implementation plan.
    *   Identify and follow implementation patterns from the existing codebase as specified in the PRP.

3.  **Execute the Plan:**
    *   Implement all the code as detailed in the PRP and your implementation plan.

4.  **Validate:**
    *   Run each validation command specified in the PRP's "Validation Loop" section.
    *   If any validation fails, analyze the errors, consult the PRP for error patterns and gotchas, and fix the implementation.
    *   Re-run the validation commands until all of them pass.

5.  **Complete:**
    *   Ensure all checklist items from the PRP's "Final Validation Checklist" are completed.
    *   Run the final validation suite one last time.
    *   Report the completion status.
    *   Reread the PRP to ensure you have implemented everything as specified.

6.  **Reference the PRP:**
    *   You can and should reference the PRP file at any time during the implementation process if you need to clarify any details.

Note: If validation fails, use the error patterns and gotchas documented in the PRP to diagnose and fix the issues before retrying.
