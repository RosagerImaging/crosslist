# Epic 2 Retrospective: User Access & Marketplace Connection
**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Participants:** Joel, Bob, Alice, Charlie, Dana, Elena

## Executive Summary
Epic 2 successfully delivered the core authentication and extension bridge capabilities. All 3 planned stories were completed with 100% acceptance criteria coverage. The team navigated early challenges with environment stability to deliver a secure and robust foundation for the application. The retrospective confirmed readiness to proceed to Epic 3.

## 1. What Went Well (Successes)
*   **Robust Auth Implementation:** Implemented Supabase Auth with Google OAuth seamlessly.
*   **Architecture Reusability:** The `EncryptionService` was built once and reused effectively for both the Extension Bridge and Marketplace Credentials.
*   **100% AC Coverage:** Rigorous adherence to requirements ensured high quality.
*   **Stable E2E Testing Pipeline:** Despite initial friction, the E2E tests for the extension are now stable and provide high confidence.

## 2. Challenges & Lessons Learned
| Challenge | Impact | Root Cause |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supabase Local/CI Instability** | CI Flakiness, Dev delays | Race conditions in local instance startup |
| **Manual Migration Oversight** | Broken builds for other devs | Reliance on manual memory to generate/commit migrations |
| **Doc/Code Drift** | Confusion on task status | Artifacts (story md files) not updated in sync with PRs |

## 3. Key Learnings & Action Items (for Epic 3)
These items are prioritized for the next sprint:
1.  **Automate Migrations:** Implement pre-commit/push checks to ensure migrations are present.
2.  **Supabase CI Optimization:** Investigate caching or wait-strategies to stabilize the CI environment.
3.  **Strict Documentation Updates:** Enforce updating story artifacts as part of the PR process.

## 4. Epic 3 Readiness (Central Inventory Hub)
*   **Scope:** Stories 3.1 - 3.4 (Schema, Add, Dashboard, Edit/Delete).
*   **Decision:** The team reviewed the proposed schema requirements and deemed them sufficient to proceed without a dedicated spike.
*   **Next Step:** Begin Contexting Epic 3 and Drafting Story 3.1.
