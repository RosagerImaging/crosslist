# Debugging Module Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Components

- Integrate Mind Map and First Principles System design.
- Define specific capabilities for the AI Code Assist Agent.
- Design the structure and query mechanisms for the Debugging Database.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features

- Develop initial proof-of-concept for the First Principles system (1 specific bug scenario).
- Implement core components of the Mind Map workflow.
- Begin building the Debugging Database.

## Phase 3: Polish and Integration

- Refine AI Code Assist Agent capabilities.
- Expand Mind Map workflow to cover more scenarios.
- Integrate Five Whys analysis into the system for root cause identification.
- Implement mechanisms to incentivize developer contribution to the knowledge base.

## Quick Commands

Create new agent:

```
workflow create-agent
```

Create new workflow:

```
workflow create-workflow
```

## Notes

- Consider using Dependency Mapping to visualize component interactions.
- Explore SCAMPER method for innovative solutions to existing debugging challenges.
- Address emergent questions: developer incentives, MVP definition, impact measurement.
