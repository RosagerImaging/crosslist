# Debugging Module Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Components

- Implement remaining agents:
  - Loop Breaker
  - React Rita
  - Test Tina
  - Inspector Git-chell
  - Chronicler
  - Playwright Pete
  - Techie Terry
- Develop remaining core workflows:
  - circular-edit-intervention
  - test-coverage-gap
  - preventive-code-review
  - query-knowledge-base
- Integrate Vercel API for seamless build log fetching and deployment triggering within the `reactive-debug` workflow.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features

- Backend Debugger (FastAPI/Python specialist)
- API Integration Debugger (Contract testing, auth flows)
- Database Debugger (SQL queries, migrations)
- Enhanced Features:
  - More sophisticated querying of the bug/solution knowledge base.
  - Full integration of the knowledge base with Archon RAG.
  - Expanded test generation capabilities.

## Phase 3: Polish and Integration

- Extension Debugger
- Marketplace Automation Debugger
- LangChain Debugger
- Agent Behavior Analyzer
- Prompt Optimizer
- Performance Debugger
- Production Monitor
- Advanced Features:
  - Proactive `test-coverage-gap` and `preventive-code-review` workflows fully implemented.
  - Advanced reporting and analytics on debugging trends.
  - Refined user interaction and reporting.
