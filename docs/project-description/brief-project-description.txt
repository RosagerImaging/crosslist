  Inventory Management system for e-commerce reseller's that consists of a central hub which contains the user's master inventory list, business and tax analytics and documents, and configurations and settings pages.
  On one side of the central hub lives the Marketplace Collection which contains each of the online e-commerce marketplaces that the user chooses to integrate with (ie eBay, Etsy, Poshmark, etc...).
  On the other side of the central hub is the collection of "AI Systems" comprised of one or more autonomous AI agents, each built and trained for specific actions and aspects of a typical ecom reseller's workflow.
    For example:
       * "Crosslisting System" - uses agents to scrape and compile parameters of the user's listing of an item from one marketplace website, compile the data, and create new listings on other integrated marketplaces, filling in that data in the relevant text blocks.
       * "Listing Optimizing System" - One agent performs background removal of item's photo's submitted by user and then adjusts contrast and brightness; one agent analyses photo's of item and performs image search to identify item by manufacturer and item name/SKU (unless SKU is provided, in which case agent pulls up same data direct from manufacturer website); one agent analyses data pulled from manufacturer website and writes listing description; one agent researches current market data and prices the item according to item condition (submitted by user - new with tag / like new / used / heavily used / etc...). 
  Many other AI Systems available, automating as much of the selling process as possible leaving the user with more time and resources to focus on sourcing inventory, marketing, and growing their business.
