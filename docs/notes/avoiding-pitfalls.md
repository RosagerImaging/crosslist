# Guide to Avoiding Common Development Pitfalls

It's commendable that you're taking a proactive approach to setting up your new project, learning from past experiences. Many developers, especially when starting out or leveraging powerful new tools like LLMs, encounter similar challenges. This guide provides actionable advice to help you maintain organization, minimize errors, and build a robust codebase.

## 1. Embrace Understanding Over Blind Execution

Your previous experience highlights a critical point: LLMs are powerful assistants, but not replacements for understanding.

- **Always Ask "Why?":** When an LLM generates code, don't just copy-paste. Ask yourself (or the LLM) _why_ it chose that approach, _how_ it works, and _what_ its dependencies are.
- **Read the Docs:** If a piece of code uses a library or framework you're unfamiliar with, spend a few minutes reading its official documentation. Even a basic understanding can prevent hours of debugging later.
- **Small Chunks:** Break down LLM prompts into smaller, more focused requests. This makes the generated code easier to review and understand.

## 2. Leverage Type Safety to Its Fullest (TypeScript)

TypeScript is your best friend for catching errors early. You've already started with a good setup; let's maximize its potential.

- **Strict `tsconfig.json`:** Ensure your `tsconfig.json` files (especially for `apps/web`, `apps/chrome-extension`, and `packages/api-client`) are configured for maximum strictness. Look for options like:
  - `"strict": true` (enables all strict type-checking options)
  - `"noImplicitAny": true`
  - `"noImplicitReturns": true`
  - `"noUnusedLocals": true`
  - `"noUnusedParameters": true`
- **Generated API Client:** The `packages/api-client` you're generating is a game-changer. Always use it for API calls. This ensures your frontend code is always type-checked against the latest backend API schema.
- **Runtime Validation (for external data):** While TypeScript provides compile-time safety, data coming from external sources (APIs, user input) can still be malformed at runtime. Consider using a schema validation library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) to validate incoming data at runtime. This adds another layer of defense against unexpected data shapes.

## 3. Embrace Incremental Development & Testing

Small, frequent changes with immediate feedback are far easier to manage than large, monolithic updates.

- **Small, Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent a single, logical change. This makes debugging easier (using `git bisect`) and code reviews more manageable.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Test-First Approach:** Even if not strict TDD, try to think about how you'll test a piece of functionality _before_ you write it.
- **Comprehensive Testing Strategy:**
  - **Unit Tests:** For individual functions and components (e.g., Jest, Vitest).
  - **Integration Tests:** To ensure different parts of your system work together (e.g., React Testing Library for UI components, Supertest for API endpoints).
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** To simulate user flows through your entire application (e.g., Playwright, Cypress).
- **Frequent Testing:** Run your tests often during development, not just before committing.

## 4. Master Code Structure & Modularity (Monorepo Principles)

Your Turborepo monorepo is an excellent choice for organization, but it requires discipline.

- **Clear Package Boundaries:** Each package (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/ui`, `packages/api-client`, `packages/eslint-config`, `packages/typescript-config`) should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Minimize Cross-Package Dependencies:** Only allow necessary dependencies between packages. Avoid circular dependencies at all costs.
- **Shared Utilities:** Create dedicated `packages/utils` or similar for truly generic, reusable functions that don't belong to a specific app.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Apply consistent naming for files, folders, variables, and functions across the entire monorepo.

## 5. Harness CI/CD as Your Safety Net

Your GitHub Actions setup is crucial for catching errors early.

- **Run All Checks on Every PR:** Ensure your CI workflow runs linting, type-checking, and all tests on every pull request. This prevents broken code from merging into `main`.
- **Deployment Previews:** For your Next.js app, configure deployment previews (e.g., with Vercel) for every PR. This allows you and others to visually inspect changes before merging.
- **Automated Releases:** Your Changesets setup will automate versioning and changelog generation, reducing manual errors in the release process.

## 6. Elevate Debugging & Error Handling Skills

Errors are inevitable; learning to deal with them effectively is a superpower.

- **Read Error Messages Carefully:** Don't just skim. Understand the file, line number, and the nature of the error. Google specific error messages.
- **Use Debuggers:** Learn to use your IDE's debugger (VS Code has excellent built-in support for Node.js and Python) and browser developer tools. Step through your code line by line.
- **Strategic Logging:** Use `console.log` (JS) or `print` (Python) strategically to trace variable values and execution flow. Remove them before committing.
- **Graceful Error Handling:** Implement `try...catch` blocks (JS) or `try...except` blocks (Python) for operations that might fail (e.g., API calls, file I/O). Provide meaningful error messages to the user.

## 7. Strategic LLM Usage

LLMs are powerful, but they are tools. Use them wisely.

- **Brainstorming & Ideation:** Great for generating ideas, alternative approaches, or boilerplate.
- **Explaining Concepts:** Ask LLMs to explain complex code snippets, design patterns, or error messages. This is a fantastic learning tool.
- **Refactoring & Boilerplate:** Use them to refactor existing code or generate repetitive boilerplate, but always review the output carefully.
- **Code Review:** Ask an LLM to review your code for potential bugs, performance issues, or style violations.
- **Verification is Key:** Always verify LLM-generated code by running it, testing it, and understanding it. Don't trust it blindly.

## 8. Continuous Learning & Documentation

The tech landscape changes rapidly. Stay curious and document your journey.

- **Learn the Fundamentals:** Solid understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, React, and FastAPI will empower you to debug and build effectively, even with LLM assistance.
- **Self-Documenting Code:** Write code that is clear, concise, and easy to understand without excessive comments.
- **READMEs for Every Package:** Each package in your monorepo should have a `README.md` explaining its purpose, how to use it, and how to develop it.
- **Decision Logs:** For significant architectural decisions, consider writing a short document explaining the problem, alternatives considered, and the chosen solution (e.g., using a simple Markdown file in `docs/decisions`).

Your context engineering system (PRD, epics, stories) is an excellent foundation for project management. By combining that with these technical best practices, you'll be well-equipped to build a successful and maintainable project.
