Joel, P.I. Playwright's mission to retrieve GitHub Actions logs terminated prematurely. He encountered a security checkpoint, requiring authentication to access the logs. Without valid credentials or a pre-authenticated session, he cannot proceed.

Therefore, the `retrieve-github-actions-logs` workflow concluded with an unfulfilled objective due to authentication requirements.

What are your commands for P.I. Playwright now, Joel? Would you like to:

1.  Provide authentication details (e.g., a GitHub token or instruct on how P.I. Playwright can sign in)?
2.  Modify P.I. Playwright to handle authentication (e.g., add a login step to the workflow)?
3.  Choose another task for P.I. Playwright, or return to the main menu?
